			The more often we see the things around us - even the beautiful and
			wonderful things - the more they become invisible to us. That is why
			we often take for granted the beauty of this world: the flowers, the
			trees, the birds, the clouds - even those we love. Because we see
			things so often, we see them less and less. We know that we are
			often judged by the company we keep. We know how influential
			classmates, friends, and other peer groups can be. If any of our
			companions are prone to be unrighteous in their living, we are
			better off seeking new associations immediately. Between stimulus
			and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose
			our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.
